# Python Gamedev
A repo to promote game development (gamedev) in Python! Help us add resources by making a pull request :) Thank You!

## Why Python?
Python is a easy language to use with an amazing ecosystem that supports it. Python also is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and continues to grow and improve. 

## What makes Python ideal for gamedev?
- Do to Python being easy to use and learn Artists, Level Designers, Game Designers, etc. can help contribute to the game's source.
- Libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Scipy allow you to speed up your game by making fast data structures simple to use and create.
- Python's machine learning libraries allow you to experiement with advanced AI, image upscalling, and much more
- The gamedev ecosystem surronding Python is begining to experience a boom with the release of Pygame2 and Ursina Engine

## Things to Keep in Mind
While Python is great in many ways it's not perfect
- Similar to Rust gamedev ecosystem Python's is still in it's begining stages but that does mean you can have quite the infulence over it
- Python has the stigma of being to slow for gamedev so it's difficult to find information about making games in Python
- The resources you can find mostly revolve around Pygame which is low level and was abanded for several years (it no longer is) which lead to the above stigma
- Python games can be difficult to distrubute but this is improving
- Python's gamedev community is very tiny but it is growing
